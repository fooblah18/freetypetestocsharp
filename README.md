Freetype rendering test:

This is a test for rendering fonts using the freetype library.
It stores each character in a mapped cache and draws the bitmap
using the bitmap buffer and glyph metrics provided by freetype.

This is also a test for the implementation of a text renderer for my
C++ game engine.
